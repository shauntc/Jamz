PART 2: Khurram's favourite Jamz
====================

Part 2 will test your abililty to make a simple tableview app

Create a New Project add a Table View Controller.

* Add a Song class, with three properties title (string), artist (string), image. Add a custom initalizer to Song that sets the three properties with given input
* Add the following array called 'songs' to your MasterViewController:
	songs will contain 3 songs:  // you can find images in the Part 2 folder
	Song 1 (title: "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", artist: "Taylor Swift", image:"taylor_swift") 
	Song 2 (title: "Baby", artist: "Justin Bieber", image:"justin_bieber")
	Song 3 (title: "Lego House", artist: "Ed Sheeran", image:"ed_sheeran")
* Make a Custom TableViewCell called SongItemCell. Display the image as the thumbnail on the left with the title and artist to the right of it. 
* Make sure your DetailedViewController has a Song property and its gets set when you pass it a song from your MasterViewController. Layout the image in the center of the screen with the Artist Name 20 points below it and the Song Title 20 points below the artist's name.

Each * counts for 10 marks. 

Good Luck!
